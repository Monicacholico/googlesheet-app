				<p><span class='bold-cap'>Every marketer</span> knows their brand is much more than a logo and a pithy tagline. And this was never clearer than coming out of 2020, when consumers were increasingly turning to brands to take action on key issues such as climate change, societal contributions, responsible business practices and more. Now is the time to speak to your brand values — and mean it.</p>
				<p>Amazon Ads recently commissioned a survey from Environics Research about the values that matter most to consumers and found that 83 percent of U.S. respondents felt more brands should do their part in helping the world, especially during difficult times.</p>
				<p>“The current generation of consumers expects brands to be values-driven and advocate for social good,” says Vann Graves, the executive director of Brandcenter at Virginia Commonwealth University. “To reach consumers, brands must be aware of and take part in the larger societal conversations happening in real time.”</p>
				<p>Looking for inspiration? Here, we will explore Indeed’s Rising Voices program, which brought multiple brands together to give opportunities to underrepresented filmmakers. It is a powerful example of values-driven advertising in action.</p>

		<!-- ::::: THE INITIAL IDEA ::::: -->

		<section class='the-initial-idea'>
			<div class='box-left'>
				<p><span class="bold-cap">The initial idea</span> for Rising Voices was simple: “What if we do this really cool thing with short films to show that jobs can change people?” recalls LaFawn Davis, the group vice president of environmental, social and governance at Indeed, a leading job-listings website. Indeed wanted the program to support filmmakers who were BIPOC — Black, Indigenous or other people of color. But how could they make the most impact?</p> 
				<p>The Environics survey found that 72 percent of U.S. consumers yearn for more diversity and representation in advertising. And 75 percent desire to learn more about the customs and heritage of racial and ethnic groups in their country. “We're at a place where if you don't have diverse voices, you're not being real,” Graves says. “And no one has the patience for fairy tales.”The initial idea for Rising Voices was simple: “What if we do this really cool thing with short films to show that jobs can change people?” recalls LaFawn Davis, the group vice president of environmental, social and governance at Indeed, a leading job-listings website.

				</div>
				<p><span class='bold-cap'>Indeed approached Hillman Grad</span> Productions, which aims to provide support systems for emerging filmmakers from underrepresented communities, and they honed the concept together: They would give $100,000 to chosen filmmakers and work with each of them to create a short film that touches on the theme of opportunity. The films would be screened at the 2021 Tribeca Film Festival, which was five months away.</p>
				<p>“In Hollywood you have to have a high level of privilege to even break into the business,” says Rishi Rajani, president of Hillman Grad. “You need money to make a short film and have something to show or no one will take you seriously. We wanted to provide this, along with ongoing mentorship for the artists.”</p>
				<p>Hillman Grad and Indeed announced the contest on social media and picked 11 filmmakers from a variety of backgrounds to create 10 shorts in only six weeks. A married couple, Deondray Gossfield and Quincy LeNear Gossfield, entered jointly with a script for their powerful short film “Flames,” about former high school friends who found themselves at a turning point in their lives and relationship. “Deondray and I have been producing television together for many years,” says LeNear Gossfield. “Rising Voices is helping us make the tough transition to directing, which is what we really love.”</p>
				<p>Indeed's Rising Voices program took a stand on inclusivity, provided genuine support to BIPOC filmmakers and had the potential to put meaningful stories from underrepresented populations in front of new audiences. But there was one problem: How could they reach a large number of viewers all around the country?</p>

				<p><span class='bold-cap'>Indeed and Hillman Grad</span> had set in motion a fantastic program, but to fulfill their goals, they needed a space to amplify the program to a large audience. That's why they turned to Amazon Ads, which offered them a massive audience throughout every part of the United States. An added bonus? With Fire TV's Stream It Forward program, Amazon helped the campaign drive even greater impact by raising money for Goodwill, the chosen charity of Indeed — donating $1 to Goodwill Industries International for every hour streamed of Rising Voices content and select titles on Prime Video, up to $200,000.</p>
				<p>“Our customers go to Amazon properties with a purpose: to read, to shop, to watch, to listen,” says Adam Key, senior marketing manager at Fire TV and Amazon. “We capture their attention in places they've chosen to organically spend time by positively enhancing their experience, rather than disrupting it. We were able to provide Indeed access to our most impactful and visual placements on the device, including in the feature rotator at the top of the screen.”</p>

				<p>The Environics survey found that 95 percent of U.S. consumers want to decide when and where they interact with a brand. And 80 percent of consumers have a strong desire for more human connection, after the recent periods of social distancing. The Rising Voices program addressed both of these needs by providing compelling, moving human stories in the short films, which were teased in engaging ad content where and when viewers were in the mood to watch. And people did watch, quickly blowing past the goal of 200,000 and exceeding it by three times.</p>
				<p>“It was incredible,” says Gossfield. “Our faces were everywhere, on the Amazon Video homepage, Fire TV, websites, social media — everywhere. Quincy and I have been doing independent filmmaking for so long, but we'd never ever had that kind of ad backing. We got so many phone calls and text messages. We felt seen. It was very, very humbling.”</p>

				<div class='above-percentage'>
					<p><span class='bold-cap'>The best connections</span> are the ones built on shared values. Brands must be genuine with consumers, build trust and demonstrate how they're committed. In the Environics survey, 62 percent of U.S. consumers indicate that they're currently purchasing from brands whose values align with their own. And 80 percent firmly believe they can vote with their dollars by supporting brands that are good corporate citizens. “If you're authentic and truthful, you have that consumer forever,” Graves says. “But if you lose them, it's hard to regain the trust.”</p>
					<p>The Rising Voices program has followed through on its mission to provide real mentorship and ongoing support for the filmmakers. “We are helping the artists find agents and managers to move their careers forward,” Rajani says. “We are also giving them jobs and working with them on TV episodes and feature films. So many of them are doing so well.”</p>

With the Rising Voices program and ad campaign, Indeed and Hillman Grad were able to tell their brand stories to a broad audience and make a lasting impact by bringing underrepresented stories directly into many people's homes. And that impact will continue: Phase two of Rising Voices is already in the works.</p>
					<p>“We want to build on top of its success,'” Davis says. “I see this program running for years to come.”</p>
